Supervised learning is typically done in the context of classification, when we want to map input to output labels, or regression, when we want to map input to a continuous output. There are two types of Supervised Learning techniques: Regression and Classification. Classification separates the data, Regression fits the data. After implementing many supervised based learning algorithms with different feature sets, we can conclude that feature engineering is very important if you want a near accurate prediction. And after implementing different algorithms on same feature set we cannot say tht one is better than the other. We just need to choose the right algorithm for that problem. We can also make the predictions more accurate by using cross validation or k-fold method. Since we have a lot of data from which the program can learn and predict this thing rule out the need of a human expert. Right now supervised learning is used in face detection, spam detection, weather forecasting, stock price predictions, etc.
